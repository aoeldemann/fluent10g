FlueNT10G - Open-Source FPGA Network Tester
===========================================

FlueNT10G is an open-source, free-to-use FPGA-based network tester. FlueNT10G
can precisely replay pre-recorded or synthetically created network traces,
capture incoming network traffic and accurately record network latencies on
a per-packet basis. The hardware design has been developed for the popular
NetFPGA-SUME_ FPGA board. The goal of this documentation is to get you started
as fast as possible and have you perform your measurements in no time.
